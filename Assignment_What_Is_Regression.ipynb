    "1. Let's assume that you have World Bank data on financial, economic and social indicators for several countries. You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why?\n",

    "  - OLS is a special type of linear regression models: \n",
    "  > **False, OLS is an optimization algorithm.**\n",
    "  - Regression models become useless if they don’t meet the assumptions of linear regression. \n",
    "  > **True; if a model does not meet the assumptions of linear regression, then we could run into problems with creating the line of best fit, etc.**\n",
    "  - Estimation and prediction are the same thing in the context of linear regression models. \n",
    "  > **False, estimation is the process of minimizing the sum of squared distances.**\n",
    "  - Linear regression is only one kind of regression model. Regression problems can also be solved with other kind of models like Support Vector Machines or Random Forests. \n",
